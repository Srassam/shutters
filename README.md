# Shutters
Creating a basic html file to start. Using bootstrap for format and Javascript for functionality. I will eventually convert this to a React site. 

This website will eventually be used for my side business for creating finish carpentry and shutters for homes. Future customers will be able to use the website to inquire about products and services. I will build out a measurement calculator to generate a rough estimate of the the services.
